        <ul>
          <li>In a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the tempeh and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to brown, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste, letting it toast slightly and begin to brown and coat the tempeh, about 2 minutes. Stir in the water and taco seasoning. Taste, and adjust seasoning and add more water, if desired. Remove from the heat.</li>
          <li>To build the tacos, scoop about 1/2 cup of the tempeh crumbles into each taco shell or tortilla. Divide the cheese, if using, and lettuce and tomatoes among each taco shell. Top with the sour cream, salsa and hot sauce, if desired, and serve.</li>
          <li>VARIATION: Instead of tempeh, use a 14-ounce block of extra firm tofu, pressed and crumbled, or a pound of lean ground meat. If using ground beef, lamb or turkey, omit the oil as the meat will contain enough fat to saute the other ingredients.</li>
          <li>NOTE: To make your own taco seasoning, for 1 tablespoon: Combine 3/4 teaspoon fine salt, 1/2 teaspoon onion or garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon paprika (any kind), 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
